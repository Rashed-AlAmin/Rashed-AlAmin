## About Me

Hey there 👋 I’m a CSE graduate who loves building things with code. My interests span software development, machine learning, and cloud technologies. I’ve worked on projects involving ML model deployment, containerized apps, and cloud setups on AWS and Google Cloud. I mostly code in Python and C, and I enjoy experimenting with system design, networking, and automation. Always learning, always building — trying to turn ideas into something real.
